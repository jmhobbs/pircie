* Path handling is sloppy and not cross platform.
* Actions should have a timestamp appended, so that things process in order (i.e. define > try_say > logger > logger )
* Plugin configuration got ugly once we switched to chains. Fix that (YAML?)
* Add "description" to all of the Plugins
* All of the Plugins should be deriving from a single class.
* Add a plugin documentation browser (see the plugins installed, see descriptions and config variables)
* Add plugin dependencies
* Add asynchronous plugins
