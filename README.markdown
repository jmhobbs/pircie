# What is pircie?

**pircie** ( pronounced like the name "Percy" _/per-see/_ ) is an IRC bot framework.

Because c'mon, there are like, zero of those out there.

It stands for uh, **P**ython **IRC** **I**ntegrated **E**nvironment. Yeah. That's it.

## How does it work?

1. You define a bot in a bot.ini file
2. You select and configure plugins (also in that bot.ini file)
3. You run server.py
4. You use your bot

It's really that easy. Don't believe me? Check out the [example bot.ini](http://github.com/jmhobbs/pircie/blob/master/bots/example/bot.ini).

## How about writing plugins?

1. Choose the [hooks](http://github.com/jmhobbs/pircie/blob/master/HOOKS.markdown) you need
2. Write functions to do what you want.
3. Add the plugin to your bots.ini

Also easy. Still don't believe me? Check out the [fortune plugin](http://github.com/jmhobbs/pircie/blob/master/plugins/fortune.py).

## I want to see a demo.

Would you like a pony with that?

Fine.

Hop onto #pircie on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net/) and give it a whirl.

## But wait!

This is still in development, so I'm probably going to break your stuff later if you try to use it now.

Fair warning.
